<h1>Creating a Webpage Part2</h1>
<!--It illustrates the structure of an HTML document is for both semantic and presentation markup to take advantage of SEO design.  -->
<p>This is a second part of the series <em>Creating a Webpage</em>. In the fist part, <a href="">Creating a webpage Part1</a> we look at how to structure a web document for both semantic and presentation purposes. In this post we are going to add features to that skeleton we created last time.<p>
<p>At the end of this tutorial you would have covered:</p>
<ul>
	<li>How to create <em>Ordered list</em></li>
	<li>How to create <em>Unordered list</em></li>
	<li>How to create a <em>table</em></li>
	<li>How to create a<em>form</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to put those components on the webpage and and style them with CSS. In the end you will have several new HTML tags into you arsenal. Let's dive in!</p>
<h3>Block-level Vs Inline Elements</h3>
<p>HTML elements can be categorized as either <em>block-level</em> or <em>inline</em> elements. <strong>Block-level</strong> element occupy the entire width of the parent container. By default browsers display a block element in a new line as a block. Examples of block-level elements are  <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> upto <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> and so on.</p>
<p>On the other hand  <strong>inline-level</strong> elements only occupies space bounded by the tags and don't break the flow of the content they are placed in. By default they don't start on a new line. Examples of <em>inline-level</em> elements are <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and so on.</p>
<h4>The Paragraph <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> Element</h4>
<p>Paragraphs in a web document are created by enclosing the text in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags. The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is both a semantic and presentational markup. As we have already said, it is also a block element. Most likely you will use alot of this element in your web projects.</p>
<h4>The Content Division <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> Element</h4>
<p><code>&lt;div&gt;</code> is a container for flow of content. It does not inherently represent anything other than grouping content so that it can be styled together. It has no semantic value. Use <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> when no other sectioning semantic element is appropriate to use. Normally, attributes such as <code>class</code> or <code>id</code> are used in the opennnig <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag to target the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with styles.</p>
<h3>Creating Unordered List</h3>
<p>Unordered list is created using <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element. Between the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code> tags are nested <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> tags. <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> stands for <em>list item</em> which enclose the items to be listed. </p>
